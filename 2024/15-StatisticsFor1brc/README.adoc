== Introduction
It is hard to avoid hearing about link:https://github.com/gunnarmorling/1brc[Gunnar Morling's "One Billion Row Challenge"] these days, where the objective is to parse and compute the min, average and max value for various weather stations using the Java language. The data to analyze is a semicolon separated list of rows that looks like this:

[source]
----
Hamburg;12.0
Bulawayo;8.9
Palembang;38.8
St. John's;15.2
Cracow;12.6
Bridgetown;26.9
Istanbul;6.2
Roseau;34.4
Conakry;31.2
Istanbul;23.0
----

As indicated by the name of the project, there are one billion such rows. I have struggled for several weeks *not* to enter the competition.

Anyway, I suspect there are some gains to be harvested if one knows the distribution of the values in the generated `measurement.txt` file of size 13 GiB (hereafter called "the file") and in this short article, I want to share my findings.

== Name Statistics

The names are UTF-8 coded and can occupy up 100 bytes of space.

Looking at the file, one can conclude that there are *413 distinct names*. So, the number of stations is actually relatively limited. Holding these in hash tables or the likes is not anticipated to take up a significant amount of memory.

=== Length

Taking a look at the distribution of the byte length (as opposed to the UTF-8 length) of the various names (if decoded by `String::getBytes`), we can see the following,

[cols="1,1"]
|===
|Size|Frequency

|3 |2
|4| 18
|5| 42
|6| 87
|7| 66
|8| 57
|9| 47
|10| 26
|11| 26
|12| 17
|13| 9
|14| 4
|15| 2
|16| 6
|17| 1
|18| 1
|24| 1
|26| 1

Here is what a frequency chart with the above figures looks like:

_Chart 1, Showing the frequency of various name byte sizes._

The corresponding cumulative frequency chars looks like this:

image:CumulativeFrequencyName.png[Cumulative Frequency of Name Byte Size]

_Chart 2, Showing the cumulative frequency of various name byte sizes._

As can be seen, considering only the first 16 bytes will cover more than 99% of the names in the file.

=== Appearance

The number of times a station appears in the file very similar ranging from "Roseau" with 2,417,155 to "Chihuahua" with 2,425,899 appearances.

=== Characters

Character values can (but does not have to) be stored as

Taking a closer look at the actual characters making up the names using binary encoded values, we can see the following:

Just considering characters a..z and not considering casing, we get the following table:

I hope this can spark some ideas in the community. Good luck with your challenge entry!
