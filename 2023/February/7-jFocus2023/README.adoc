== Introduction
In my talk at jFocus 2023 in Stockholm, I talked about project Panama and more specifically the Foreign Function and Memory API.

== Live Demos

=== link:src/main/java/org/minborg/jfocus2023/Demo1MemorySegment.java[Demo 1: Memory Segment]

This class shows basic use of a `MemorySegment` which is an abstraction of a contiguous 64-bit memory region providing:

* _Spatial_, _temporal_ and _thread-confinement_ safety
* Bidirectional interoperability with arrays and various `ByteBuffer` types.

=== link:src/main/java/org/minborg/jfocus2023/Demo2Arena.java[Demo 2: Arena]

This class shows how an `Arena` can be used to provide safe and deterministic release of memory resources.

=== link:src/main/java/org/minborg/jfocus2023/Demo3MemoryLayout.java[Demo 3: MemoryLayout]

This class shows how the concept of `MemoryLayout` provides a structured way of describing the layout of linear memory. It also shows how memory segments can be dereferenced using `VarHandle` objects that, in turn, can be derived directly from a `MemoryLayout` instance.

=== link:src/main/java/org/minborg/jfocus2023/Demo4Encapsulation.java[Demo 4: Encapsulation]

This class exemplifies how `MemoryLayout` constructs can be encapsulated in normal classes providing "Java-like use" for simplified use with retained performance.

=== link:src/main/java/org/minborg/jfocus2023/Demo5HugeArrays.java[Demo 5: Huge Arrays]

This class shows how large arrays of custom `MemoryLayout` can be constructed. These arrays do not suffer from the normal Java second level of indirection that normal arrays have. These arrays are furthermore not limited to having 2^31^ - Îµ elements but are instead only limited by the amount of allocated memory.

=== link:src/main/java/org/minborg/jfocus2023/Demo6DownCalls.java[Demo 6: Downcalls]

In this example, we explore how to call native methods using the built-in FFM linker.

=== link:src/main/java/org/minborg/jfocus2023/Demo7MemoryMapping.java[Demo 7: Memory Mapping]

In this demo, we will see how large `MemorySegments` (up to 64 TiB) can be created by means of memory mapping. Read more about memory mapping in http://minborgsjavapot.blogspot.com/2023/01/java-20-colossal-sparse-memory-segments.html[this separate article].

=== link:src/main/java/org/minborg/jfocus2023/Demo8InfiniteArena.java[Demo 8: Infinite Arena]

This class outlines an implementation of an `Arena` that appears to be able to provide an almost unlimited amount of memory. The concept also allows post-mortem analysis of memory segments used. Read more about the `InfiniteArena` in a separate article http://minborgsjavapot.blogspot.com/2023/01/java-20-almost-infinite-memory-segment.html[here].
