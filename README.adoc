=== Presentations at Devoxx BE October 2023

I did two presentations at Devoxx and also participated in the "Ask the Java Architects" presentation.

Thanks to all who provided feedback and those who attended
the presentations. See you next year!

=== link:2023/September/14-Trusted-Records/README.adoc[Java Records are "Trusted" and Consequently Faster] (2023-Sep-14)

Did you know Java records are trusted by the Hotspot VM in a special way? This makes their speed superior in some aspects compared to regular Java classes. In this short article, we will take a look at _constant folding of instance fields_ and how this can bolster the performance of your Java application.

=== link:2023/August/25-Panama-String-Performance/README.adoc[Java 22: Panama FFM Provides Massive Performance Improvements for Strings] (2023-Aug-25)

The Panama Foreign Function and Memory (FFM) API is slated to be finalized in Java 22 and will then be a part of the public Java API. One thing that is perhaps less known is the significant performance improvements made by FFM in certain areas in 22. In this short article we will be looking at _benchmarking string conversion_ in FFM for Java 21 and Java 22 compared to using old JNI calls.

=== link:2023/August/2-Computed-Constants/README.adoc[Java: JEP Draft: "Computed Constants"] (2023-Aug-2)

The draft JEP "Computed Constants" went public. `ComputedConstant` objects are superfast immutable value holders that can be initialized independently of when they are created. As an added benefit, these objects may in the future be even more optimized via "condensers" that eventually might become available through project Leyden.

In a link:2023/January/26-PerformanceImprovementsRevealed/[previous article], I talked about how serialization and file I/O performance was improved in Java 21 thanks to the use of `VarHandle` constructs. The method employed there has now also been applied to Java’s image-handling library making it faster. Here is what happened.

=== link:2023/February/7-jFocus2023/README.adoc[jFocus 2023 Presentation: Panama Foreign Function and Memory API] (2023-Feb-7)
The Panama FFM API previewed for a second time in JDK 20. In this article, we will see how to make use of the new APIs and how to call native functions in a native library. This article summarized key points made at https://www.jfokus.se[jFocus 2023 in Stockholm].

=== link:2023/January/26-PerformanceImprovementsRevealed/README.adoc[JDK 21: Performance Improvements Revealed] (2023-Jan-26)
_In Java 21, old code might run significantly faster due to recent internal performance optimizations made in the Java Core Libraries. In this article, we will take a closer look at some of these changes and see how much faster your favorite programming language has become. Buckle up, for we are about to run at full speed!
